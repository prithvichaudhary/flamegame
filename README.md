Python is a multipurpose language and one can do literally anything with it. Python can also be used for game development. Let’s create a simple FLAMES game without using any external game libraries like PyGame.

FLAMES is a popular game named after the acronym: Friends, Lovers, Affectionate, Marriage, Enemies, Sibling. This game does not accurately predict whether or not an individual is right for you, but it can be fun to play this with your friends.

There are two steps in this game:

Take the two names.
Remove the common characters with their respective common occurrences.
Get the count of the characters that are left .
Take FLAMES letters as [“F”, “L”, “A”, “M”, “E”, “S”]
Start removing letter using the count we got.
The letter which last the process is the result.
